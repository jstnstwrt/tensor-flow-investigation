    "2. **Portability:** historically lots of this work has been designed to run on gpus and clusters and wasnt neccessarily easily available for the everyday person to run on there own machine. this makes this possible. so if you write your code on your own pc, then want to scale it up to run on a gpu (or mobile), you dont have to change your code to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexibility:** \"TensorFlow isn't a rigid neural networks library. If you can express your computation as a data flow graph, you can use TensorFlow. You construct the graph, and you write the inner loop that drives computation.\n"
